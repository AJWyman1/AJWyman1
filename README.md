### Welcome friends! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Alex Wyman and I am currently a Software Engineering student at Northern Vermont University. I am scheduled to graduate in May 2024

Before starting school, I served 6 years in the US Navy as a flight deck electrician on board the USS Harry S Truman.

- ðŸ‘€ I'm currently looking for an internship, preferably remote, anywhere within the software development field.
- ðŸ¦€ I recently fell in love with Rust and I am open to any position working with it in any capacity.
  - simple [Multi-Threaded Neural Net](https://github.com/AJWyman1/rust_net) for my final project last semester in Rust.
